                <h2>Bio</h2>
                    <p>Hi! Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Shuhong Gu, originally from China, and I currently reside in Plano, Texas. I am a junior at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, pursuing a major in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>In university, I am an active member of the Rutgers Student Association. Outside of academia, I embody compassion and a willingness to help others. I volunteer as a photographer for local church baptisms, assist my mother with her catering business, and help my father expand his online business. These experiences not only enrich my life but also allow me to contribute positively to my community.</p>
                    <p>My passions extend beyond the classroom to reading, traveling, and gaming in my free time. I have a profound interest in computer science, dedicating daily efforts to self-study various aspects of the field. In 2022, I completed a course on "Computer Algorithm Design and Analysis" offered by the University of California, Berkeley, and earned a certification.</p>
